Here are the steps to achieve this using JavaScript:

**1. HTML Structure (index.html):**
   Started by creating a basic HTML structure for your webpage. We'll need an HTML element 
   (e.g., a <div>) to represent the main content area and a button for changing the background color.

**2. CSS Styling (style.css):**
   We can add some basic CSS styles to make your content look presentable.

**3. JavaScript Functionality (index.js):**
   Now, let's add the JavaScript code to change the background color when the button is clicked.

   **steps:-**
  -> We select the button element using getElementById.
  -> We define a function getRandomColor to generate a random color.
  -> We create a function changeBackgroundColor that changes the background color of the body element by setting the backgroundColor property to a random color.
  -> We add a click event listener to the button, so when it's clicked, it triggers the changeBackgroundColor function, changing the background color.
  -> Now, when you open the HTML file in a web browser, you'll have a button that changes the background color when clicked.
